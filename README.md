# Pathfinding
Artificial Intelligence - A* algorithm for pathfinding


This repository contains implementations of some basic Pathfinding algorithms using C++. Pathfinding algorithms are used in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially in gaming design. In this repository, 3 basic algorithms have been implemented: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS) and A* Search algorithm. The implementations using C++ contain only A* algorithm.
